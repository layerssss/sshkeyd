sshkeyd
=======

Forget about ssh keys

* [中文说明](README_zh.md)
* you don't need to tell me who's your teamates, I can get them from your GitHub organizations.
* don't give me public keys of yours & others, I can get them from your(their) GitHub account.
* you don't need to worry about other keys in server, I can pluck them out for you.
* all you need to do is tell me where is the server, and let me do the rest.
* bonus! teamates can also visit the dashboard and see which servers are authorized to them.

## Installation

* install `nodejs` (`homebrew install nodejs`, maybe)
* `sudo npm install sshkeyd -g`
* `sshkeyd`
* open your browser and go to [http://localhost:10000/](http://localhost:10000/)

## Secrurity

`sshkeyd` only authorized access by keys retrieved from Github, not from user input. So don't worry, GitHub has taken care of your keys.

## Where is the configuration

It's at `~/.sshkeyd.json`, feel free to hack on it.
